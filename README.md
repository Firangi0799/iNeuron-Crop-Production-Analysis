This is my first internship project with iNeuron.
The topic is "Crop Production Analysis"
I chose this topic because I am an agri graduate and wanted my first project to be somewhat related to my backgroud.

The problem statement was to analyze the given data and scrape out the insights which will help in forecasting crop production trends.
